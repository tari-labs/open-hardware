<h1>RISC-V Devices</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V">RISC-V</a> is a free processor architecture provided under Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licenses that do not require fees to use. Therefore, anyone can manufacture devices utilizing RISC-V without patent and copyright issues associated with other chipset architectures. Two RISC-V devices are of interest to Tari due to their FOSS ecosystems: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Precursor</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PINE64 Star64</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tari has not yet been tested on these devices and will need to be compiled from source for the <code>risc64</code> <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Ports/riscv64">architecture</a>.</p>
<h2>Precursor</h2>
<p><img src="img/precursor-parts-01.jpg" width="800" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/precursor">Precursor</a> is a development platform developed by <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/">Bunnie Huang</a> for secure mobile communication. This pocket-sized device accommodates a built-in display, a physical keyboard, and an internal battery while remaining smaller and lighter than the average smartphone. It is powered by an FPGA-hosted, soft-core System-on-Chip (SoC) and gives developers the freedom to inspect, verify, and customize nearly every aspect of its operation.</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>Detailed documentation about the Precursor is <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/precursor">available on CrowdSupply</a>.</p>

<h2>PINE64 Star64</h2>
<p><img src="img/star64.jpg" width="600" /></p>
<p>Star64 is a RISC-V based Single Board Computer powered by StarFive JH7110 Quad-Core SiFive U74 64-Bit CPU, Imagination Technology BX-4-32 GPU and supports up to 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR4 memory. It provides an eMMC module socket, MicroSD Card slot, PCI-e, Pi-2 Bus, USB 3.0, and many other peripheral interfaces for makers to integrate with sensors and other devices. </p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>This device has not been released yet, though PINE64 has a large FOSS community and has released RISC-V compatible boards in the past. Documentation is available on the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/STAR64">PINE64 wiki</a>.</p>

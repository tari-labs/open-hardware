# Running Tari on Open Hardware platforms

[<img src="img/tari-base-node.jpg" width="600" />]

Tari is a digital assets focused blockchain protocol that is built in Rust, private by default, and is being architected as a merge-mined sidechain with Monero. In a world without default privacy, businesses cannot operate, our personal preferences and histories are sold to the highest bidder, and we lose the ability to conduct our lives in the manner we choose. The Tari community fundamentally believes that privacy-enhancing software should be pervasive and available to all.

The Tari project releases its code as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and is designing a codebase that will empower developers of any skill level to quickly build useful applications that leverage the Tari network. The best way to get started is to start running a Tari node. A Tari node is the basic building block of the Tari blockchain and network. Nodes perform the critical functions of maintaining the ledger. Without nodes, there is no network.

This repository is one aspect of our dedication to FOSS and Open Hardware platforms.
